# Distilled Feature Fields Enable Few-Shot Language-Guided Manipulation

### [üåê Project Website](https://f3rm.github.io) | [üìù Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07931) | [üé• Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA9rWWVWsc4)

We distill features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, and enable few-shot language-guided manipulation
that generalizes across object poses, shapes, appearances and categories.

## Code
**The NeRF and feature distillation code will be released soon.**

We currently provide our implementation for extracting CLIP and DINO features. See `scripts/demo_extract_features.py`
for a demo.

### Installation
**Note:** this repo will eventually require an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 11.7+ for NeRF and feature field distillation.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/f3rm/f3rm.git
cd f3rm

# Create conda environment. Feel free to use a different package manager
conda create -n f3rm python=3.10
conda activate f3rm

# Install torch per instructions here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Choose the CUDA version that matches your GPU
pip install torch==2.0.1+cu118 torchvision==0.15.2+cu118 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install F3RM project and dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Usage
**Extracting CLIP and DINO Features**

Run `python scripts/demo_extract_features.py` for a demo on how to extract CLIP and DINO features.
This will create a plot showing the PCA of the CLIP and DINO features. The plot is saved to `demo_extract_features.png`.
