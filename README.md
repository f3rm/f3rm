**F3RM:** Feature Fields for Robotic Manipulation

We distill features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, and enable few-shot language-guided manipulation
that generalizes across object poses, shapes, appearances and categories.

## Code

We currently release our implementation for training feature fields. We will release our custom viewer and the robot
manipulation code soon.

F3RM is built on top of [Nerfstudio](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio) following their
[guide for adding new methods](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/developer_guides/new_methods.html). For a summary
of the codebase structure, see [assets/code_structure.md](assets/code_structure.md).

### Installation

**Note:** this repo requires an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 11.7+ for NeRF and feature field distillation.

#### 1. Setup conda environment

```bash
# We recommend that you use conda to manage your environment
conda create -n f3rm python=3.8
conda activate f3rm
```

#### 2. Install Nerfstudio dependencies

```bash
# Install torch per instructions here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# Choose the CUDA version that your GPU supports. We will use CUDA 11.8
pip install torch==2.0.1+cu118 torchvision==0.15.2+cu118 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install CUDA toolkit, you can skip this if you already have CUDA 11.8 installed
# You can check your existing CUDA installation with `nvcc --version`
conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda-toolkit
export CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX

# Install tiny-cuda-nn, this will take a few minutes
pip install ninja git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch
```

#### 3. Clone and install F3RM

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f3rm/f3rm.git
cd f3rm

# Install F3RM and its dependencies
pip install -e .

# Install command-line completions for nerfstudio
ns-install-cli

# Test your installation, check that 'f3rm' is a valid method
ns-train --help
```

**Note:** if you have a previous installation of Nerfstudio, make sure it does not conflict with the new installation
in the `f3rm` conda environment. Run `which -a ns-train` and check that the first entry points to
`$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/ns-train`. If it doesn't, then you may need to deactivate all conda environments and only activate
the `f3rm` environment.

## Usage

### Downloading Example Datasets

We provide example datasets of tabletop and room-scale environments which you can download using
the `f3rm-download-data` command. By default, the script will download all the datasets (requires ~300MB disk space)
into the `datasets/f3rm` directory relative to your current directory.

Run `f3rm-download-data -h` to see how to download specific datasets or set your own save directory. We provide a short
description and preview of each dataset in [assets/datasets.md](assets/datasets.md).

### Training a Feature Field

We provide the functionality to train a NeRF and distill features in parallel. The default features we distill are CLIP
features. You can distill DINO features instead by adding `--pipeline.datamanager.feature-type DINO`.

```bash
ns-train f3rm --data <data_folder>
```

You can try F3RM with the example datasets which you can download following the
[instructions here](#downloading-example-datasets) (try out `f3rm/panda/scene_001`). Alternatively, you can prepare your
own datasets following the instructions in the
[Nerfstudio documentation](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/custom_dataset.html).

Note that while we focused on tabletop environments in the paper, F3RM can be scaled up to much larger environments. Try
training feature fields on the example [rooms datasets](assets/datasets.md#rooms).

You do not need to run the training to completion. We save a checkpoint every 2000 steps by default. To see all the
options available for training, run `ns-train f3rm -h`.

#### Resuming Training from a Checkpoint

Use the `--load-dir` flag to resume training from a checkpoint. Nerfstudio writes the checkpoint files to the `outputs/`
directory relative to your current directory.

```bash
ns-train f3rm --data <data_folder> --load-dir {outputs/.../nerfstudio_models}
```

Checkout the [Nerfstudio documentation](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/first_nerf.html) for more details
on functionality.

### Using our Custom Viewer

Our custom web viewer is coming soon! Keep an eye on out for updates.

### Using the Nerfstudio Viewer

Once you have started training the feature field with `ns-train`, Nerfstudio will print a URL to the viewer in the
terminal (the URL will start with https://viewer.nerf.studio). You can open this URL to open the Nerfstudio viewer in
your browser to visualize training progress and the feature field. Alternatively, to visualize a trained model you can
run `ns-viewer --load-config {outputs/.../config.yml}`.

Note that if you are using a remote server, you will need to forward the port to your local machine
([instructions](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/viewer_quickstart.html#training-on-a-remote-machine)).
The default port used by Nerfstudio is 7007, but check the viewer URL to make sure. For a general guide on how to use
the Nerfstudio viewer, check out
their [documentation](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/viewer_quickstart.html).

#### Visualizing the Feature Field PCA

To visualize the PCA of the features, select `feature_pca` in the `Render Options -> Output Render` dropdown box.
Note that the initial PCA projection matrix is computed based on the features rendered at your current viewpoint.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f3rm/f3rm/main/assets/images/ns_viewer/feature-pca_option.png" width="400" alt="feature_pca in Output Render dropdown">

To recompute the PCA projection based on your current viewpoint, click the "Refresh PCA Projection" button under
`Trainer/pipeline/model` near the bottom of the controls.

#### Language Interaction with CLIP Feature Fields

If you are distilling CLIP features (the default feature type), then you will see the following additional controls
under `Trainer/pipeline/model` near the bottom of the controls panel. You can enter positive and negative text queries
(separated by `,` commas), which will compute similarity heatmaps. You will need to click out of the text box or press
the enter key to submit the query.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f3rm/f3rm/main/assets/images/ns_viewer/f3rm_controls.png" width="400" alt="Additional Controls for F3RM in the Nerfstudio Viewer">

To visualize these heatmaps, select `similarity` in the `Render Options -> Output Render` dropdown box. It may take a
few seconds for this option to show up on the first query, as we load CLIP lazily.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f3rm/f3rm/main/assets/images/ns_viewer/similarity_option.png" width="400" alt="similarity in Output Render dropdown">

We show the similarity heatmap over the `f3rm/panda/scene_001` dataset for the "Baymax" query, with the negatives in the
controls above (you can download this dataset using the `f3rm-download-data panda` command). Try playing around with
different language queries and see what results you get!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f3rm/f3rm/main/assets/images/ns_viewer/baymax_heatmap.png" width="500" alt="similarity heatmap for Baymax">

**Note:** if multiple positive queries are specified, we average their CLIP embeddings before computing the pair-wise
softmax described in Section 3.3 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07931). The default temperature of 0.1 works
well. If no negative queries are specified, then we show the cosine similarity between the positive query and the
feature field.

### Extracting CLIP and DINO Features

We provide scripts to demonstrate how to extract CLIP and DINO features from their respective vision models. You can
use these features for your own NeRF pipeline or for other downstream applications.

- Run `python f3rm/scripts/demo_extract_features.py` for a general demo on how to extract CLIP and DINO features.
  This will create a plot showing the PCA of the CLIP and DINO features. The plot is saved
  to `demo_extract_features.png`.
- For details on how to extract CLIP features and compare the extracted features with CLIP text embeddings, run
  `python f3rm/scripts/demo_clip_features.py`. This script will create a plot showing the similarity heatmaps for a
  given
  text query, and will save a plot to `demo_clip_features-{text_query}.png`.

## Troubleshooting

### Language queries are not working in Nerfstudio viewer

The Nerfstudio viewer can sometimes fail to register the input you type into the text boxes if you are use the same
browser tab for different training runs. This means `feature_pca` and `similarity` may not appear in the Render Options.
To fix this issue, try closing the tab with the viewer in your browser and opening it again. If this doesn't work,
please open an issue in this repository.

### Running out of GPU memory

This codebase was tested on a RTX3090 with 24GB of GPU memory. We observe a peak memory usage of ~6GB when training a
CLIP feature field **without** using the viewer. When the viewer is used in conjunction with training, the peak memory
usage is ~12GB.

If you are running out of memory when using the Nerfstudio viewer, try:

1. Decreasing the number of rays per batch when rendering by using the `--pipeline.model.eval-num-rays-per-chunk 8192`
   flag when running `ns-train`.
    - The default rays per chunk is 16384, which uses ~12GB of memory (at `Max Res = 512`).
    - 8192 rays per chunk uses ~10GB memory. Decreasing this number will further reduce memory usage, at the cost of
      slower rendering.
2. Decrease the rendering resolution in `Max Res` under Render Options in the Nerfstudio viewer.

If you are running out of memory during any other stages, please open a GitHub issue and we will try to help.
